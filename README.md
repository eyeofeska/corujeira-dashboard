# A Corujeira dashboard

Custom Lovelace cards for the Home Assistant dashboard at A Corujeira, an off-grid land in the Minho Valley, Portugal. Each card is a single, dependency-free JavaScript file.

| Card | Type | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`corujeira-flow-card.js`](cards/corujeira-flow-card.js) | `custom:corujeira-flow-card` | Power flow: up to 3 sources on top, a hub, up to 4 loads below, with animated wiring-diagram lines. |
| [`corujeira-span-card.js`](cards/corujeira-span-card.js) | `custom:corujeira-span-card` | Wraps any card and overlays range pills driven by an `input_select`. |
| [`corujeira-forecast-card.js`](cards/corujeira-forecast-card.js) | `custom:corujeira-forecast-card` | Next 12 hours (2-hourly) above a 5-day forecast, from any `weather` entity. |
| [`corujeira-meteogram-card.js`](cards/corujeira-meteogram-card.js) | `custom:corujeira-meteogram-card` | Multi-model Open-Meteo meteogram with rain agreement, wind, a written summary and land advice. |
| [`corujeira-hoot-card.js`](cards/corujeira-hoot-card.js) | `custom:corujeira-hoot-card` | Hoot the land wizard: an owl with a speech bubble of land advice (from the meteogram and Vigia fire watch), each line with a recolourable icon. |
| [`corujeira-silo-card.js`](cards/corujeira-silo-card.js) | `custom:corujeira-silo-card` | A water tank drawing that fills to the current level, with the % inside and litres beside it, plus an optional pump switch with run-time pills and countdown. |
| [`corujeira-fire-card.js`](cards/corujeira-fire-card.js) | `custom:corujeira-fire-card` | IPMA fire risk and weather warning, plus nearby NASA FIRMS hotspots and wind direction. |

## Install

All seven cards ship as one file, `dist/corujeira-dashboard.js`.

**With HACS:** HACS > three-dot menu > Custom repositories > add `eyeofeska/corujeira-dashboard`, type Dashboard. Download it, then refresh the browser. HACS registers the resource for you, and new releases show up as updates.

**By hand:** copy `dist/corujeira-dashboard.js` into `config/www/`, then add it under Settings > Dashboards > Resources as `/local/corujeira-dashboard.js`, type JavaScript module.

Options are documented in the comment block at the top of each file in `cards/`.

## Making a change

1. Edit the card in `cards/`.
2. Run `node scripts/build.mjs` to rebuild `dist/corujeira-dashboard.js`, and commit both.
3. Bump `version` in `package.json` and push to `main`. With no releases published, HACS tracks the latest commit on `main` and offers each push as an update (HACS checks about every 48 hours; "Update information" in HACS checks now).
